        Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, 
        its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, 
        so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the 
        “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
        The greenhouse effect is when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back 
        into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon 
        dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global 
        temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global warming.
